# This is Dr. Phil's New Update!
Today I am learning all about Git and having so much fun!

The list below includes some of the commands that I used:
- git clone \<repository-name\>
- git checkout -b \<branch-name\>
- git status
- git add \<file-name\>
- git commit -m "a commit message"
- git push
- does this fix things?

You should keep practicing so you become a real Git ninja!
